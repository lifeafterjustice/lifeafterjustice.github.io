							<p>
								The Life After Justice Center was founded by Antoine Day and Jarrett Adams. Antoine and Jarrett have a special interest in starting The Life After Justice Center, because they’re both exonerees themselves. Both men suffered grave injustices by the criminal justice system and spent years of their lives in prison for crimes they didn’t commit. Now they want to help others that have suffered through similar experiences.

							<p>
								Antoine Day was convicted of first-degree murder in 1992 and was sentenced to sixty years in prison.  After serving a decade in prison, Antoine’s conviction was overturned with the help of his attorney, Howard Joseph.  While some exonerees stand in the limelight upon release, Antoine quietly picked up the pieces of his life. He initially took employment in the construction field, and today he is the Outreach Coordinator of Prison Reentry at the Howard Area Employment Resource Center. In this position, Mr. Day mentors at-risk teens and parolees, implements job training and placement programs, and runs neighborhood stabilization and anti-violence programs. Antoine’s work helps to better inside and outside Illinois state prisons.

							<p>
								After serving more than nine years in prison, Jarrett Adams was released in 2009 when the 7th Circuit reversed his conviction on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel.  Immediately following his release, Jarrett sought to regain the life he lost when he was convicted at just 17 years of age.  Jarrett received his bachelor’s degree in May 2012 from Roosevelt University and he is currently a law student at Loyola University Chicago School of Law.  Jarrett also works full-time as an investigator for the Federal Defender’s Office in Chicago.
